# NucleoSpeedo
Speedometer/Tachometer firmware for STM32-Nucleo32 board.

## Note if you forgot this!

* CubeMX generates __ONLY__ project files for selected toolchain, all the sources remain in the CubeMX project directory.
* Regenerate sources from CubeMX __AFTER__ changing toolchain path to
'Builds/\_cubemx' directory, so TrueSTUDIO project files remain unchanged.
